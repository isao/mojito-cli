mojito-cli [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isao/mojito-cli.png)](https://travis-ci.org/isao/mojito-cli)
==========

`mojito-cli` is a command line tool for [Mojito](https://github.com/yahoo/mojito) developers. `mojito` components that are unrelated to the core library and runtime will be moving to separate packages.


Install mojito-cli
------------------

With [npm](http://npmjs.org/), do

    % npm install --global mojito-cli

Try it

    % mojito help

Note that if `mojito` was already installed globally, it will be uninstalled. It is recommended to only install the core `mojito` package as a local dependency in your mojito application. Users should not have any loss of functionality.

Quick Start
-----------

Create an app (which installs `mojito` locally using npm) and a mojit.

    % mojito create app myapp
    % cd myapp
    % mojito create mojito hellomojit

Start the server

    % mojito start

In a browser, open

    http://localhost:8666/@hellomojit/index
