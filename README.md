==========

`mojito-cli` is a command line tool for [Mojito](https://github.com/yahoo/mojito) developers. `mojito` components that are unrelated to the core library and runtime will be moving to separate packages. 

_* * * More information on the command line package changes, and the current status [here](https://github.com/yahoo/mojito-cli/wiki). * * *_

Install mojito-cli
------------------

With [npm](http://npmjs.org/), do

    % mojito create app myapp
    % cd myapp

Start the server

    % mojito start

In a browser, open

    http://localhost:8666/@hellomojit/index
