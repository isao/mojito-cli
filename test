// FIXME find a better way to run all tests, with or without coverage.
//
// this script requires all ./tests/*.js files to run tests in a
// single process for istanbul; however exit code is always 0.
//
// tap tests/*.js runs same tests (over-reporting number of tests),
// but in separate processes, so istanbul can't provide coordinated
// coverage. tap does exit with non-zero code if there are failures,
// which is needed for travis.
